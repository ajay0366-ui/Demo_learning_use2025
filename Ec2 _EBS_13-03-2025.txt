# EBS

practical:

1) create ebs volume and attch ec2
2) increase ebs volume (create 2-3 ebs andattach)
3) attach and deatach ebs volume
4) forcefully stop ec2 root volume
5) craete snapshot ebs and attach other region and other az also
6) create snapshot policy to regular data backup porcess ( why no data loss )
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EBS stand for elastic block storage 
its a storage type
its a compare other storage type its a expensive (using ssd) but giving best performance ssd (boost work)
ebs also know as volume ..
u can change volume size after create modify is possibal (10 gb then modify 50gb)

*type of ebs volume
SSD, HDD, magnetic disk.... 

main type;

1. genral purpose  gp2 and gp3 (SSD)
2. provisioned iops io1, io2 (SSD)  ( using high task support only windows work)

(save large amount data)
(boot not support)
3. throuput optimized hdd 
4. cold hdd
5. megnetic hdd

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

*how to create ebs storage 
go ec2 storage find volume option and create

(ebs volume lunch by default with when u create ec2 server automaticlly (8GB) at least need lunch instances(server).. 
but, when u create sepreate then at least create 1 gb .)

-u can attach multiple ebs volume with one ec2 (ex. 1 Root and other 3  ebs volume.. )
- but your ebs volume in use already then u can`t attach same volume another server..(mind it)
- one server (ec2) multiple ebs attach but need same Az (az -1b -- az-1b connect other not )
- you forcefully stop ur root volume call deattch volume but its a risky  casue crash server..
 
imp :-  you can connect ec2 and ebs same az ...


IOPS : - input output operation is per second (speed 10mb per/s 50gb per/s) (ex. boost your gameing fps  then smooth run, task fast.)
Root volume : - Main boot storage (os) when install ec2 automatically create

#Snapshot

- ebs volume backup 
- save or copy your data

*benifits
1) backup purpose use
2) dister recovry
3) anytiem avibility
4) some time migetate your data 

*how to create snapshot

u have ebs volume then click action button copy sanpshot then done.

- ebs not direct connect one Az to other Az but snapshot is send (ex. Az 1a --- Az 1b   possibal )
- snapshot (ebs voume ) transper one region to another region possibal (if u have done snapshot particular ebs volume )

*lifecycle policy

- Automatically backup your data (cron method (see format cron))
- crearte 12345 snap then automaticlly off one by one and final 5 save main data ...

Q. can i increse EBS storage size ?
--> yes u can increase ebs storage.

Q. can i decrease Ebs storage and why?
--> no. bcuz  if aws give decrease size option then u will lost your files something data inside 
	(i know im delete my file and backup but some cache, footprint is still avilable in volume)

Q. if i delete ec2 server a Additional volume also delete?
--> no. bcuz additonal volume purpose is save your data form any Dister and other server crash but root 
	volume delete.

Q. if lost my key and pair or suddenly crash my server how to get back my data?
--> alreday create ebs volume deatach ec2 connect with other ec2 or creaer snapshot also save your data.

Q. my data is very cruical can i backup my data everyday or regular bases?
--> yes.  u need automatic data backup your ebs volume (lifecycle policy and set your data (hourly weekly montly and yeraly)
