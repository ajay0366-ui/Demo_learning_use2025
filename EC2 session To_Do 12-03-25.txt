Ec2

its one of core and major imp service in aws..
ec2 stands for elastic compute.
its a felxibal  scalibility serivce
same as your computer but u can access through virtaul only 

adv.
auto on off (scalibility) 
no maintaince 
its full secure
its a region specific service



- some types ec2 instances

1) On-Demand : - Normaal working (start and off) --- imp work use

2) Reserverd : - get some discount but buy 1 - 6 or more month needed.  ------ company budget save 

3) spot : -  sale offer and most discountable but its a time limited aws remind you before 3-5 minute close your server price is increase sale is over
	     you have no any contorl -----  not imp work only time limeted work do it

4) Deticated : - custom (ssd storage all ) depand your work 



diff type of ec2 family :

General purpose. Amazon EC2 general-purpose instances can handle a variety of workloads. ...
Compute optimized. ...
Graphics processing unit. ...
Memory optimized. ...
Storage optimized. ...
Accelerating computing. ...
HPC optimized. ...
Micro.



imp  ec2 also know as (instance, server, virtual machines, virtual computer also) 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
practical session

1. create ec2 vitrual machine. and log in seesion over the browser
2. create security group and assigne port no also
3. create security group and access public and private (ssh) 
4. SG assigne inbound rules  (ssh,tcp all,http ) and learn outbud rule 
5. create key value pair 
6. download private key (rsa key)... and login through ssh
7. dowload git and login ssh ec2 machine (bcuz windows session is not good for direct access )

#Port

port means the way of access computer 
its a rule of protocol 
around  65000 ports.
order to access way of internet access 
port means (Home  ---- your get ---- entery)

ex. only access http then use 80 and use HTTPS then  443 use SSH 22

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# security group 

virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic ..
set of rules 
inbound and outbound rules in SG
0.0.0.0 means all traffic allow .. (public allow)
security group is stateful. (track the state of a connection between a sender and receiver.)
like a watchman (who enter your society ) allow or not ...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Key Pair

univiersal key and lock 
why use security purose 
key pair  work  (public ----aws   and private -- customer  ) 
key pair is imp if u can access remote job or work 
using with terminal git 
always save you key in good location if delete or lost not recoverable and u can not access your server (its security prupose )
key is not regenrate 
you can not change your key also

key pair its encrypted security end to end user  .
RSA (its a algorthims  to encrypted save your key)
ppt pormat use putty (but noit use noe days) only support linux and some os
pem. use all os and most using format 
ED version only use macos and linux (win not support)

Imp ask Questions

1. if server(EC2) is in stop will you still charge?
--> Not chargble.. (if you can connect with storage then indirectly charge)

2. My server is in a running state but i am unable to access give me a resson why? time out my server also ?
--> pls check your security group and give persmission to or allow port access (depand service ) 
    firewall means security gruop problem .. not give prot right

3. how can access remotely ec2 server?
--> create key and pair then go ssh login option and follow step 
   once follow step then pase of laocte your key pair (key RSA) then log in without key can`t login.

4. If lost my key can i access my server or can i regenrate my key ?
--> No you can not access your server or not regenrate your key.
